'''
Use latitude and longitude lines to divide the world into a grid. Assign each station to a grid and save the grid label in the station's meta data. This can be used to average anomalies by grid using all the stations within that grid. All grid boxes with data can then be averaged to form a world wide average.

Code for set_station_grid_cells() is loosely based on gridding logic from:

Some variable names have been renamed but most logic remains intact. I was unable to contact aljones1816 to get his permission to use this code. It should be assumed that the use of the gridding logic in this project should not be construed as a reflection on his work since the context for my code and his are very different. If this code is found to be flawed here, it should in no way reflect poorly on him. aljones1816 if you see this code, please reach out to me at codingfriend1@gmail.com.

  '''
  Since the grid boxes have smaller surface area closer to the earth's poles, we need to reduce the influence/weight of the smaller boxes to account for the smaller area using the mid-latitude of the grid box
  
    "A degree of longitude is widest at the equator with a distance of 69.172 miles (111.321 kilometers). The distance gradually shrinks to zero as they meet at the poles. At 40 degrees north or south, the distance between a degree of longitude is 53 miles (85 kilometers). The line at 40 degrees north runs through the middle of the United States and China, as well as Turkey and Spain. Meanwhile, 40 degrees south is south of Africa, goes through the southern part of Chile and Argentina, and runs almost directly through the center of New Zealand."
